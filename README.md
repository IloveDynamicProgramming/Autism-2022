# Autism-2022
**Author**: Tri Duc Nguyen

**Inspiration**: This product is for the autistic children at Thien Duyen Mentor after my field trip last May.

**Three functions of this application**
  - Showing articles about infants to provide information for parents/guardians
  - Designing tests for parents to further understand whether their children contracted autism or not considering health index and criteria given by experts
  - Giving advice and exercise for parents to guide their children through the hardships of this disease
